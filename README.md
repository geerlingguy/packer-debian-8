# Packer Example - Debian 8 minimal Vagrant Box

**Current Debian Version Used**: 8.10.0

**Pre-built Vagrant Box**:

  - [`vagrant init geerlingguy/debian8`](https://app.vagrantup.com/geerlingguy/boxes/debian8)
  - See older versions: http://files.midwesternmac.com/

This example build configuration installs and configures Debian 8 amd64 minimal using Ansible, and then generates two Vagrant box files, for:

  - VirtualBox
  - VMware

The example can be modified to use more Ansible roles, plays, and included playbooks to fully configure (or partially) configure a box file suitable for deployment for development environments.

## Requirements

The following software must be installed/present on your local machine before you can use Packer to build the Vagrant box file:

  - [Packer](http://www.packer.io/)
  - [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (if you want to build the VirtualBox box)
  - [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) (or Workstation - if you want to build the VMware box)
  - [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)

## Usage

Make sure all the required software (listed above) is installed, then cd to the directory containing this README.md file, and run:

    $ packer build debian8.json

After a few minutes, Packer should tell you the box was generated successfully.

If you want to only build a box for one of the supported virtualization platforms (e.g. only build the VMware box), add `--only=vmware-iso` to the `packer build` command:

    $ packer build --only=vmware-iso debian8.json

## Testing built boxes

There's an included Vagrantfile that allows quick testing of the built Vagrant boxes. From this same directory, run one of the following commands after building the boxes:

    # For VMware Fusion:
    $ vagrant up vmware --provider=vmware_fusion
    
    # For VirtualBox:
    $ vagrant up virtualbox --provider=virtualbox
